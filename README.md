Overview

This repository contains a fault tree model used for reliability and safety analysis of variant-rich systems in product line engineering. The model represents a 150% fault tree, capturing all possible features and variants, and serves as the basis for probability computation and Monte Carlo–based failure rate analysis.

The implementation and modeling approach are based on the research presented in the following IEEE publication.
